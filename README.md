# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a study guide I will be using to document and keep track of what I learn during the coding bootcamp.
It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript.


## Installation
Download the files to your local machine

## Usage
To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
